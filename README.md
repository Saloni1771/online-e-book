# online shopping system advanced
online shopping system is a [DBMS project] with both admin and user layouts.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Education system has been effectively shifted to online forums in today’s world. Starting from online examinations to augmented reality labs, we have moved a long way. Even though a lot has changed, the books are the golden oldies of the education system. But in this world of crash-courses and youtube videos, it’s hard to find the appropriate books to suffice our needs. We plan to provide a one-stop solution for this struggle by providing personalized solutions for anyone and everyone when it comes to education.

## SOLUTION
1. We want to provide an online platform to provide books personalised for every individual.
2. It will provide support to efficient learning, thus enhancing user experience
3. Users would be able to make separate orders for books which aren't available in stores or other online platforms easily.
4. Using Chatbots to understand the requirements of the user.
5. Collecting data from users and using ML model to get personalized effects
6. We can also implement a section of non-educational books, by following popular trends and personalized choices.
7. We will also create a window for donating used books and then we can provide those books to the needy
